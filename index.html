<h1>Team Work</h1>
<p>There are many advantages associated with teamwork. Firstly, the group project will allow the participants to share skills and learn from each other, ultimately helping each other to improve. 
Group projects are also an effective way to work faster as the workload will be distributed among the participants, which will make it easier to go through large amounts of course material. A lot of companies will demand their employees to work in groups to boost productivity. 
To solve a problem, it is important to view it from different perspectives, considering the weak and strong points of every suggestion. A group will consist of people with diverse backgrounds and expertise who will be able to view the problem from their side and give their opinion. 
Reasoning each argument, sparring ideas, discussing, challenging each otherâ€™s opinions, and collecting feedback will be valuable to find the best possible solutions for the problem.
