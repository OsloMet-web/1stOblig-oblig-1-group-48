<h1>Team Work</h1>
<p>There are many advantages associated with teamwork. Firstly, the group project will allow the participants to share skills and learn from each other, ultimately helping each other to improve. 
Group projects are also an effective way to work faster as the workload will be distributed among the participants, which will make it easier to go through large amounts of course material. A lot of companies will demand their employees to work in groups to boost productivity. 
To solve a problem, it is important to view it from different perspectives, considering the weak and strong points of every suggestion. A group will consist of people with diverse backgrounds and expertise who will be able to view the problem from their side and give their opinion. 
Reasoning each argument, sparring ideas, discussing, challenging each other’s opinions, and collecting feedback will be valuable to find the best possible solutions for the problem.

<h1>Why teamwork?</h1>

<h2>Pros for working in a team</h2>
<ol><li>When you work in a small group it is possible to get different
    views and opinions. With new perspectives and expertise, the
    idea can be adapted and optimized into something better. This
    way, along with discussions, a group can potentially develop a
    complex idea together.</li>

<li>It can be more motivating than working alone. You always
    have someone in the same situation, and you can help each
    other. It’s harder to end up procrastinating when someone is
    watching you and is depending on your effort.</li>
<li>The work that needs to be done will ideally be shared between
    the group members, which can lead to efficiency. Because you
    feel pressured to follow the time schedule, and to stay focused.
    This is especially true if the group members are strangers. You
    want to be polite and formal around strangers</li></ol>
    
<h2>Cons for working in a team</h2>
<p>It can be hard to work in a group, if not everyone is willing to
    put in the same amount of work. Some may work there ass off
    and others get a free pass. Also, everyone work at different
    speeds and use longer/shorter time on a task, not only do
    people work in different speeds, but people have a different
    time schedule and it can be hard to find time to meet up.
    There can also be some tension if there comes up a
    disagreement/conflict, conflicts may be hard to solve.</p>
